      Is about a young girl named Chihiro's quest to save her parents. At the
      beginning of the movie, Chihiro and her family get lost in the forest and
      find themselves in what seems to be an abandoned town. However, they find
      some delicious looking food at a food stand in a marketplace. Chihiro is
      suspicious, but her hungry parents begin eating the food, giving the
      excuse that they will pay later. Suddenly, both of her parents turn into
      pigs! As Chihiro has just discovered, that food was made and cursed by
      spirits, in order to ensnare careless humans and turn them into pigs for
      food. With the help of a boy named Haku, she escapes being taken as well
      and finds work in a nearby spirit bathhouse where she plans to free her
      parents. The person who employs her is named Kamaji, and he runs the
      boiler room. The room where he works was based off of a real western-style
      stationary store in the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architecture Museum in the
      Musashi Koganei district of Tokyo:
